# Minecraft Server Generating Tool
## Easy MC Server - https://easymcserver.tech
#### A simple way to get a minecraft server up and running in no time!

## An SBUHacks Hackathon Project
### Background
#### This project was created by two students. We both are avid players of minecraft, and have been for some time. Each time we wanted to start up a new server and play with eachother, or with some other friends, we found the proccess to be a hassle, very repetitive, and often times confusing. We decided to remedy this by automating the process!
### SBU Hacks Hackathon
#### This project was developed for entry in the 2020 SBUHacks Hackathon. We both had a wonderful time coding it, and thank the organizers for a seamless and fun 24 hours!
#### The bulk of the code, as a result, was developed in 24 hours.
### Methods
#### We utilized our Web Development skills taught in our courses to develop a lightweight, easy to use graphical interface. We coded the Front-End primarily in Vue.js, a framework we were both unfamiliar with at the start of the project. 
#### A site visitor can modify any aspect of the server they wish through the 'Downloads' page. Users can simply click/enter the fields they wish to add to your minecraft server, hit the download button, and voila! A script is downloaded that will set up the server automatically!
#### The script was written in Powershell, and goes through all the necessary steps! No hassle at all!
